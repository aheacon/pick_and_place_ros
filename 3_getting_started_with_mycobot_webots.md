## 1. Getting started with ROS2 and myCobot with Webots simulator

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have installed [ROS2](0_ros2_getting_started.md)
- Make sure that `underlay` workspace is properly sourced `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`
- Make sure you have installed [Webots](webots/0_webots_getting_started.md)

### 1.1 Based on
1. [mycobot_webots](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_webots)

### 1.2 Steps to build
<details>
  <summary>
    Create directory and start
  </summary>

  - Get the directory
    ```bash
    $  mkdir ros2_ws_webots && cd ros2_ws_webots
    $ git clone https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_webots.git
    $ $ ll mycobot_webots/
    total 32
    drwxrwxr-x 7 anel anel 4096 Oct  7 11:19 ./
    drwxrwxr-x 3 anel anel 4096 Oct  7 11:19 ../
    drwxrwxr-x 8 anel anel 4096 Oct  7 11:19 .git/
    drwxrwxr-x 6 anel anel 4096 Oct  7 11:19 mercury_a1/
    drwxrwxr-x 6 anel anel 4096 Oct  7 11:19 mercury_b1/
    drwxrwxr-x 6 anel anel 4096 Oct  7 11:19 mycobot_280_pi/
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 anel anel 1074 Oct  7 11:19 README.md
    drwxrwxr-x 2 anel anel 4096 Oct  7 11:19 res/
    ```
  - Start the `webots`
    ```bash
    $ webots
    ```
  - Load the `world` file from `webots` GUI: `File -> Open World` and choose `mycobot_webots/mycobot_280_pi/worlds/mycobot_280_pi.wbt`
  - We must get the following

### 2. Create custom package and use on mycobot
TODO

### 2. Troubleshooting

#### 2.1 Opening the world file
- When `webot` starts and world file from `mycobot` is used, robot will fail, with errors

- **FIX**
  - To fix the issue `Pause` and `Reset Simulation` (restore to initial state) or `Tools->Preferences->General->Startup mode` and choose `Pause` over `Real time`

## TODO üõ†Ô∏è
- TODO for later
- Eveything else is blocked since there is no way to simulate interface (no `launch` file between ROS2 and Webots). 
  - Options:
  1. Use `ubuntu 20.4` (`ROS1`) - issue: VM settings
  2. Use `ROS2` and `Gazebo` - issue: learning `Gazebo`
  3. Postpone this scope and switch to [Scope 2 (`NVIDIA Isaac`)](#scope2)
