# Optional and troubleshooting

#### Rosdep missing  for mycobot
- This is step to check compatilbity before building (not needed for now).
```bash
$ rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y
ERROR: the following packages/stacks could not have their rosdep keys resolved
to system dependencies:
...
mycobot_280: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [actionlib]
mycobot_320: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [actionlib]
mycobot_320pi: Cannot locate rosdep definition for [actionlib]
...
```
- No fix needed

#### Launch file problem
```bash
$ ros2 launch mycobot_320 test.launch.py
